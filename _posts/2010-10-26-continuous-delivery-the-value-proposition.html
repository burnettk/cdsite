<p>In our book, Dave and I focussed mainly on the principles and technical practices of continuous delivery and its ecosystem: things like automated testing, managing configuration, environments, and data, and implementing a deployment pipeline. One of the things we didn't spend much time on was the business context and value proposition of continuous delivery. In a way that's just as well, because the book is already long enough.</p>
<p>However this context is important - and not just because it helps you convince your boss to implement continuous delivery. One of the big technical memes of the last year has been <a href="/2010/08/continuous-delivery-vs-continuous-deployment/">continuous deployment</a> - the practice of releasing every good version of your software, often multiple times a day. But that practice came out of a business imperative, which finds its general expression in the <a href="http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/">lean startup movement</a>. In startups, it's essential to get a minimum viable product available to users and then iterate rapidly based on real feedback. Sometimes you need to change direction in a more radical way (known as pivoting) if you discover what you built isn't valuable.</p>
<p>When building <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/UtilityVsStrategicDichotomy.html">strategic (as opposed to utility) software</a> in a non-startup environment, many of the same imperatives apply. Furthermore, continuous delivery has other important benefits: for example, it reduces the risk of each individual release substantially, and provides a true measure of project progress.</p>
<p>I've found myself talking a lot about the value proposition of continuous delivery since I wrote the book, so I thought it would be useful to write it all down. You can get hold of my essay <a href="http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1641923">here on InformIT</a> for free. InformIT have also made <a href="http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1621865">chapter 5 of my book</a> - which explains the deployment pipeline in some detail - available free of charge too.</p>
