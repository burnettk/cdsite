<p>I am delighted to report that <em>Continuous Delivery</em> is being used as the set text for the <a href="http://www.softeng.ox.ac.uk/subjects/APE.html">Agile Engineering Practices</a> course, which forms one of the modules for the <a href="http://www.softeng.ox.ac.uk/">Software Engineering MSc</a> at Oxford University.</p>
<p>This is especially sweet for me since I did my BA at Oxford. It's also where I first got into systems administration. I accidentally reformatted my hard drive, and I couldn't get hold of a copy of Windows. Instead, I popped down to computing services and picked up some new free operating system distribution called RedHat, so I could write my philosophy essays (using emacs, of course).</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://chatley.com/">Dr Robert Chatley</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/rchatley">@rchatley</a>), who teaches the course, for letting me know. He says he chose <em>Continuous Delivery</em> since it "gave the best motivation for putting all the technical practices together ... [it] gave the big picture of what we were trying to do - minimise the cycle time from idea to delivery, and allow that cycle to be repeated frequently and reliably". He has a write-up of the course <a href="http://chatley.com/posts/07-04-2011/oxford-agile-engineering-practices/">here</a>.</p>
<p>He was kind enough to let me reproduce a picture of the students with their course text. I wish them all the best with their future endeavours.</p>
