<p>Dave and I (Jez) have submitted the final draft of <a href="http://my.safaribooksonline.com/9780321670250">Continuous Delivery</a>, and the people at Addison Wesley are aiming to have it published ready for <a href="http://agile2010.agilealliance.org/">Agile 2010</a>.</p>
<p>There are going to be a number of talks on the content of the book this year.</p>
<p>Kent Beck, Timothy Fitz and I are doing a webinar on continuous deployment hosted by Alan Zeichick of SD Times. It's at 1pm EDT on 30 June. You can sign up <a href="http://bzmedia.com/agility/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I'm giving the keynote at <strong><a href="http://gihyo.jp/event/2010/agile">Agile Tokyo 2010</a><span style="font-weight: normal;">, which is on July 21.</span></strong></p>
<p>Martin Fowler and I are doing a half-day tutorial on continuous delivery on Monday 9 August at <strong>Agile 2010</strong>. More details <a href="http://agile2010.agilealliance.org/schedule.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Finally (for now), Martin and I will be doing a full day tutorial on continuous delivery at <strong>QCon San Francisco</strong>, 1-2 November. More details will follow <a href="http://qconsf.com/sf2010/tutorials/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I look forward to seeing you at one of the events!</p>
