title: Evidence and case studies

Continuous Delivery is mainly associated with the DevOps movement and
the practice of continuous deployment. There are many case studies
that fall into this sweet spot, from John Allspaw and Paul Hammond's
canonical 2009 Velocity talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdOe18KhtT4">"10+ Deploys Per Day: Dev and Ops
Cooperation at Flickr"</a> to Ken Exner's talk on <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCrhemssYuI">transforming
software development</a> at Amazon. If you want to see more
traditional companies talk about their journey, check out the videos
from the DevOps Enterprise Summit <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/user/DOES2014">2014</a> and <a

There are also a number of case studies presented in the various sections of
this website.

However continuous delivery is not just for web companies. The beauty
of these techniques described on this site is that they can be used in all sorts of
domains---essentially, anywhere where your software development
capability is considered a <a

asset</a>. Continuous delivery has be applied in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMS97X5ZTGc">mainframe
environments in financial services companies</a>. It's also been used
to improve quality and productivity and drive down cost and lead times
in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Trqjj3d3lhQ">embedded
systems</a>.
