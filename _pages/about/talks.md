I've given a lot of talks on continuous delivery over the years. Some of them are included in this guide. You can find a list of some of the main ones below. I don't accept many speaking engagements these days because of my work commitments, but I do occasionally speak at conferences and at companies (at my consulting day rate). My contact details are at the bottom of this page.

###A note on contacting me###

The best way to reach me is by email at humble@acm.org, but unfortunately due to the large amount of email I receive I can't guarantee a timely response. I allocate a fixed amount of time to dealing with email, with the result is that my backlog is long and growing. I apologize in advance.
