title: What is Continuous Delivery?
---

Continuous Delivery is the ability to get changes of all
types---including new features, configuration changes, bug
fixes---into production, or into the hands of users, _safely_ and
_quickly_ in a _sustainable_ way.

Our goal is to make deployments&mdash;whether of a large-scale
distributed system, a complex production environment, an embedded system, or
an app&mdash;predictable, routine affairs that can be performed
on demand. We want to eliminate integration and hardening phases and
code freezes.

We achieve all this by ensuring our code is _always_ in a deployable state,
even in the face of teams of thousands of developers making changes on
a daily basis. 

### Why continuous delivery?

Continuous delivery isn't just about making software
deployments painless, low-risk events, although this is the main
motivation behind the principles and practices described
here. Continuous delivery has several other important benefits:

* __Reduced time to market__. By automating much of the non-value-add
  activity in software development, such as build, deployment,
  environment provisioning, and regression testing, we enable software
  teams to move faster.
